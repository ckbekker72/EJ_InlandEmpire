Persons with severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, are at higher risk because their medications may interfere with self-regulation of body temperature. Increasing heat exposure can also worsen the clinical condition of people with pre-existing chronic diseases and mental health problems."
Vulnerability Indicators,Environment,PM2.5 concentration,"PM2.5_Concentration, state rank, county rank",ppm annual,census,static,historical,2009-2011,,,Annual mean ambient concentration of PM2.5,"Air Monitoring Network, California Air Resources Board (CARB)","Particulate matter (PM) is one of two indicators of air pollution, ozone being the other, that is linked to short- and long-term adverse health effects. PM2.5 is capable of reaching deep into the lungs and causing a host of diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory disease, and acute respiratory infections. The health impacts of air pollution are likely to be exacerbated by climate change, because degradation of air quality will compound the health hazards posed by warmer temperature."
Vulnerability Indicators,Environment,Ozone exceedence,"OzoneExceedence, state rank",exceedance days (3-year),census,static,historical,2009-2011,,,Three-year ozone concentration exceedance above state standard,"Air Monitoring Network, California Air Resources Board (CARB)","Higher temperatures increase ground-level ozone and other secondary air pollutants created from chemical reactions with pollutants directly emitted from power plants, motor vehicles, and other sources, creating smog and air pollution. With projected increasing temperatures, demand for electric power generation will increase and may contribute further to poor air quality. Laboratory studies in which human subjects were exposed to measured concentrations of ozone for brief periods demonstrate that ozone can reduce lung function, increase respiratory symptoms, increase airway hyper-reactivity, and increase airway inflammation."
Vulnerability Indicators,Environment,Percent impervious surfaces,"PCT_ImperviousSurfaces, state rank, county rank",%,census,static,historical,2011,,,Percent of the land area covered by impervious surfaces (population weighted),"Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium, National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2011","Impervious surfaces retain heat and limit absorption of water into the ground, which can lead to the urban heat island effect, a phenomenon in which urban areas are warmer than the surroudning non-urban areas. Communities of color are disproportionately represented in densely populated areas with more impervious surfaces, which increases their risk of exposure to heat stress. Studies in cities, including Montreal, Barcelona, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and in the United States found associations between heat-related health effects and impervious surfaces."
